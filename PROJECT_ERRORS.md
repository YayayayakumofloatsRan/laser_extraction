# Project Errors And Risks

## Open Items

- The physical board scale currently assumes `1.0 mm` center spacing. If the real effective spacing differs, extrinsic translation scale must be recalibrated.
- Light-plane calibration has not started yet, so the full structured-light pipeline is still incomplete.

## Current Calibration Baseline

- The camera calibration stage uses OpenCV circle-grid detection with blob area constraints tuned for the `Campos-8` dataset.
- Reprojection error should be checked after every future image-set expansion instead of reusing old parameters blindly.
